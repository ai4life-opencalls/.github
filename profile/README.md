:tada: Welcome to the AI4Life - Open Calls repository :tada:


Each year, several projects are selected for deep learning support. The AI4Life Open Calls team then spend 6 months 
investigating ways to improve existing workflows and the applicability of deep learning to the selected projects.

In this repository, you can find a list of the finalized pipelines for each Open Call.
